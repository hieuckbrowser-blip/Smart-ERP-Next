## Team Role Assessment Addendum (2026-06-29)

A role-based review has been added in `docs/team-role-gap-assessment.md` to translate the roadmap into a real dev-team operating model. The highest-priority gaps are product/test traceability, API governance, observability, security program automation, PWA/offline hardening, release rollback playbooks, and data governance for forecast/analytics.

| Role area | New gap | Priority | Tracking |
|-----------|---------|----------|----------|
| Product + QA | PRD/persona/acceptance criteria must trace to automated tests | High | GAP-ROLE-01 |
| Architecture + Backend | API versioning baseline and error catalog shipped; ADR/domain-boundary work remains | High | GAP-ROLE-02/03 |
| SRE + DevOps | Observability stack baseline and alert rules shipped; staging/rollback drill and SLO burn-rate alerts remain | High | GAP-ROLE-04/08 |
| Security | Secret scanning now gates commits/CI; dependency/container scans and ASVS matrix remain | High | GAP-ROLE-05 |
| Frontend/PWA | Production PWA manifest, service worker, offline fallback, and asset tests shipped; conflict UX matrix remains | High | GAP-ROLE-06 |
| Data/AI | Data contracts, PII classification, forecast accuracy monitoring | Medium | GAP-ROLE-09 |
| Support/Docs | Incident runbook, support triage SOP, troubleshooting matrix | Medium | GAP-ROLE-10 |

## Closed (Won't Fix)

| Gap | Notes |
|-----|-------|
| CSRF protection | JWT Bearer tokens (stateless) — CSRF only applies to cookie auth |
| Build time optimization | Docker layer cache + CI cache + parallel workers applied |
